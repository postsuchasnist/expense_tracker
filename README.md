Here is a semester project for Java Programming language course. It is an Expense Tracker application. It uses Java Swing to create a graphical user interface represented as a table. There you can see five boxes, each shows the repective amount: Total Incomes, Total expenses, Average Incomes, Average Expenses and Total Amount. There is a table with transactions, transactions are stored in array. There are two buttons add transaction and remove transaction. By pressing
add transaction the corresponding window pops up and there you can choose a type of transaction: Income/Expense; Amount, Description and a Date when the transaction was made. Then by clicking add button, transaction is added to 
the table and instantly shows in the table. If tou want to delete a transaction from the table, just select a transaction and click remove transaction. There is a currency converter, which converts between USD, Euro and Czk
and it only converges the data in the boxes to the corresponding amounts. !!! If you want to remove a transaction, the currency should be set to USD!!! Also there is a button switching between ligth and dark modes and 
a timer which shows actual time with precision to seconds.
